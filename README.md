# Comprehensive-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Power-BI



## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of data analytics, the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights is crucial for decision-making and strategic planning. Power BI, a powerful business analytics service by Microsoft, provides a robust platform for data analysis, visualization, and sharing insights across an organization. This project aims to leverage the full spectrum of Power BI's capabilities to demonstrate a comprehensive data analysis process from sourcing data to creating interactive visualizations and deploying them on various platforms.

## Case study

Tailwind Traders requires a detailed report that outlines the company’s latest sales and profit overview. Tailwind Traders is a wholesaler company that is involved in the sales of housing and construction accessories. Ranging from Ultra grip hammer, luminous bulb 60w,        Oakwood shelf, protile cutter, garden glove set, and steel nails (1 inch) to mention a few.                    
The spreadsheet for this project contains about 55 unique product items, including the customer name, product descriptions, email address, etc. To achieve the sale and profit overview we are going to focus on the financial data like the gross product price, tax per product, quantity purchased, gross revenue, total tax, and net revenue, others are stocks, loyalty points, product category, and so on 

## Problem statement

Using MS Excel to obtain data from various sources and then clean, transform, and load the data for further analysis.

**Designing** a data model and modeling data in Power BI.

Creating model calculations using **DAX** and optimizing model performance

Creating and enhancing **dashboards** and reports for usability, storytelling, and identifying patterns and trends.

**Configuring alerts.**

## Data sourcing

All data used in this project was provided by the Coursera for the purpose of this project but the link for the dataset such as c.s.v, pbix and python script will be attached when necessary.

  ### Spreadsheet 

For starters, we have to do the following:
- Prepare the sales data worksheet to ensure accuracy before integration into Power BI.
- Understand the components of the sales data, such as individual sales per day and the corresponding gross amount.
- Implement formulas to determine the net amount by subtracting tax from the gross amount.

Tailwind Traders requires a detailed report that outlines the company’s latest sales data. The report must contain gross amounts and the difference between gross and net sales. Let’s create this report so it can shape its future sales strategies.
